# Read me for LED Display 8x11 hardware

This project is created using KiCAD (v5.1.6).

This is a simple 8x11 LED matrix driver that can interface with an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi board.

The layout has been created with perfboards in mind (with the front layer being wires and the back layer being sloder traces) and therefore is not the most optimal for manufacturing.
